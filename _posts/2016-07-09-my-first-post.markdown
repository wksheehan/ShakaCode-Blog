This is my first post on my jekyll blog page. It was pretty easy to set up the website using terminal and some [online instructions](https://help.github.com/articles/setting-up-your-github-pages-site-locally-with-jekyll/#requirements). I also looked up how markdown works, which is a common document formatting for creating these posts (which I do from my text editor Atom). So far this summer I have finished the Ruby on Rails tutorial by Michael Hartl, which was pretty challenging, but with the help of some of the guys at Shaka Code I got through it. Although at this moment I could most likely not create a brand new website all on my own, the tutorial taught me a lot of the basics of Rails and I now have a good understanding of how the whole process works. I realized how complicated developing a website can be (such as security issues) but how using rails makes it easier.

I will be posting most likely once or twice a week, keeping a log of all that I learn as I continue working with Shaka Code and being a part of their team, and as I add my own contribution to their new app that they are working on.

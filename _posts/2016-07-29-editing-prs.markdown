This week I haven't done too much work regarding this internship because one, I've been really busy; two, I haven't had much to do. I met with Dylan on the 21st and we created a google docs page outlining the test work flows that needed to be tested on staging. We ended up doing most of it together, and the rest was easy and there were no errors. I am hoping that soon I will begin writing my own code or making some tangible contribution to the friends and guests website.

When I met with Dylan, however, I learned a lot of new stuff. We called up Rob on Screen Hero and together the three of us went through Samnang's (another coworker's) latest pull request. He had made a lot of new code changes, but they were easy to make out using a website called Reviewable. Reviewable uploads the github pull request and arranges it in a side-by-side format with the previous code on the left and the new code on the right. Additions to the code were highlighted in green while the places he removed code were red. In this way it was very convenient to look at just the places he changed things, assuming all the previous code worked; at the same time, we could see the changes in context. Reviewable also made it really easy to comment on certain places in the code if we found any bugs. As we were going through it, Dylan actually caught quite a few and made note of them. We as viewers can't physically change the code--only Samnang can do that--but as we comment Samnang will see all the things he needs to fix and make the changes himself, then upload an updated pull request that should get accepted and merged into staging. As we went through the pull request each changed document at a time, Rob and Dylan explained the code to me, most of which weren't too hard to understand.

What I found most interesting about this process, that I came to realize that day, was how my perception of what a "program" is had changed. Before this internship I had been strictly working in Python, and all the programs I had made, especially my AP Physics models in VPython, had been one page of code that you run and get an output. If there was a bug, you would get an error and a line number. Now, my more broadened knowledge of coding knows that Ruby on Rails and making even the simplest of websites is much more than just one page of code. It is a full folder of documents and external packages all put together and deployed with the help of other online tools to create a dynamic and interactive webpage. For example, things like Sidekiq work as a background rails engine to make things run faster. You also need a whole team of people, and the errors aren't always so simple as one line of code, rendering the trial and error process I got so accustomed to not as helpful here.

It has been nice being able to work at home for most of this summer and choose my own hours, just like the actual people at ShakaCode do. I would be really excited to work for a company like this. Some cool things about their home "offices" I like:

Underneath their stand-up desks are footstools where they can rest a foot to alternate their weight, which is nice to have during hours of standing.

They have multiple screens that are hooked up to one computer, between which they can drag and view several windows at once. It reminds me a lot of the Iron Man movies, where Tony Stark does the same thing but with a touchscreen hologram thingy.

They have really cool keyboards that apparently makes typing easier, but which honestly looks *harder* to me. But I bet once you get the hang of it it makes things a lot faster. (Mom, I know what I want for Christmas!)
